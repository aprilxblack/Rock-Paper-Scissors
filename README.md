# Rock-Paper-Scissors
It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. It has very primitive AI behind it as well. 

Try playing the same option many times in a row and see what happens. There are things loging onto a console as well to those interested. 

[The actual game looks like this](Rock-Paper-Scissors)
